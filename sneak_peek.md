This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* New features
  + ADIOS BP read capability -- Reading ADIOS 1.x BP formatted file. 
    PnetCDF will detect BP file format automatically. No additional flag needed when opening a BP formatted file.
    Currently, the ADIOS driver does not support the low-level API.

* New optimization
  + none

* New Limitations
  + ADIOS driver is ready only. For more detail on limitations, please refer to /doc/README.ADIOS.md

* Update configure options
  + Enable ADIOS support.
    - `--enable-adios`: enable reading BP formated file
    - `--with-adios=/path/to/netcdf-4`: path to ADIOS library installation
  + When building with NetCDF-4 feature, using NetCDF-4 library built with
    PnetCDF enabled, i.e. --enable-pnetcdf, is not supported. See
    [Issue #33](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/issues/33).
  + Option `--with-netcdf4` now allows a form of `--with-netcdf4=INC,LIB` in
    addition to `--with-netcdf4=DIR`. This is in case the include and lib
    folders of NetCDF-4 installation are in different locations.

* New constants
  + NC_BP, NF_BP, and NF90_BP is the flag indicating BP file access mode.
  + NC_FORMAT_BP, NF_FORMAT_BP, and NF90_FORMAT_BP indicate BP file format.

* New APIs
  + none

* API syntax changes
  + none

* API semantics updates
  + none

* New error code precedence
  + none

* Updated error strings
  + none

* New error code
  + NC_EADIOS, NF_EADIOS, NF90_EADIOS
    ADIOS library internal error that does not corresponds to any PnetCDF error code.

* New PnetCDF hint
  + none

* New run-time environment variables
  + none

* Build recipes
  + none

* New/updated utility program
  + ncmpidump
    It can now be used to dump BP formated file.

* Other updates:
  + none

* Bug fixes
  + When `--enable-netcdf4` is used at configure time, users may encounter
    problem during configure or make time, if the NetCDF4 library was built
    with static libraries only. Thanks Bruno Pagani for reporting. This has
    been fixed in
    [pull request #46](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/46).
  + When calling a nonblocking API with a zero-length request and argument
    request ID being NULL, segmentation fault may occur. See
    [PR #51](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/51)

* New example programs
  + examples/adios/read_metadata.c - Dump all metadata in a ADIOS BP file.
  + examples/adios/read_var.c -  Read a variable form a BP file generated by the 
    ADIOS example program examples/C/arrays/arrays_write.
  + examples/adios/read_var_nb.c -  Read a variable form a BP file generated by the 
    ADIOS example program examples/C/arrays/arrays_write using non-blocking API.

* New programs for I/O benchmarks
  + none

* New test program
  + test/adios/open.c - tests if PnetCDF recognize ADIOS file.
  + test/adios/header.c - tests if PnetCDF can parse ADIOS header.
  + test/adios/var.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS variables.
  + test/adios/varm.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS variables with discontiguous memory.
  + test/adios/vars.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS variables with stride.
  + test/adios/ivar.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS variables using non-blocking API.
  + test/adios/ivarm.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS variables with discontiguous memory using non-blocking API.
  + test/adios/ivars.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS variables with stride using non-blocking API.
  + test/adios/att.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS attributes.
  + test/adios/indep.c - tests if PnetCDF can access ADIOS variables independently.
  + test/burst_buffer/varn.c -- to test varn API when burst buffer driver is
    used. The test includes cases when argument counts are is or some of the
    elements in counts are NULL.
  + test/nc4/notsupport - Test if error code NC_ENOTSUPPORT is properly
    returned when calling APIs for unsupported NetCDF-4 feature.
  + test/nc4/rec - Test creating and reading a NetCDF-4 file with 1 unlimited
    dimension. 
  + test/nc4/rec2 - Test opening a NetCDF-4 file with more than 1 unlimited
    dimensions.

  + none

* Issues related to MPI library vendors:
  + none
