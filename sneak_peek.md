This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* New features
  + none

* New optimization
  + When inserting nonblocking requests into pending queues, keep the queues
    sorted (insert sort) in the increasing order of variable starting file
    offsets. This can avoid a sorting (quick sort) when flushing the pending
    requests. See [pull request #37](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/37).

* New Limitations
  + When building with NetCDF-4 feature, using NetCDF-4 library built with
    PnetCDF enabled, i.e. --enable-pnetcdf, is not supported. See
    [Issue #33](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/issues/33).

* Update configure options
  + none

* Other updates:
  + none

* Bug fixes
  + Fix error checking for programs in examples/C to ignore NC_ENOTENABLED
    if PnetCDF was not built with --enable-profiling. Thanks to Bruno Pagani
    and see [Issue #34](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/issues/34).

* New example programs
  + none

* New programs for I/O benchmarks
  + none

* New test program
  + test/burst_buffer/varn.c
    Test varn API in burst buffer driver. The test includes cases when counts is NULL or some of the count in counts is NULL.

* Conformity with NetCDF library
  + none

* Discrepancy from NetCDF library
  + none

* Issues related to MPI library vendors:
  + none
